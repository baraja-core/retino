Retino
======

This is an unofficial PHP package with Retino integration for handling complaints and returns in your e-shop.

How does it work?
-----------------

Retino is an online service for easy resolution of e-commerce complaints. This package makes it easy to connect your e-shop to Retino.

To run correctly, you just need to pass a collection of available orders (the `OrderCollection` interface from the `baraja-core/ecommerce-standard` package) and get the finished XML feed.

You can read more about how the feed works internally in the official documentation: https://www.retino.com/help/developers/retino-xml-feed/
